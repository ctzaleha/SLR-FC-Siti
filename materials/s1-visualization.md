## Contribution üõ†Ô∏è
Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/drshahizan/SLR-FC/issues) for any improvements, suggestions or errors in the content.

Here is a summary of the document:

- **Title and Authors**: The document is titled "Exploration of Possibility of Driver‚Äôs Drowsiness Prediction with High Accuracy using Both Physiological and Behavioral Measures" and authored by Atsuo MURATA, Kensuke NAITOH, Taiga KORIYAMA, and Makoto MORIWAKA from Okayama University, Japan.
- **Aim and Method**: The document aims to explore the effectiveness of physiological and behavioral measures for predicting drivers' subjective drowsiness. The authors used EEG, heart rate variability, blink frequency, neck bending angle, back pressure, foot pressure, COP on sitting surface, frequency of body movement, tracking error, and standard deviation of pedal operation as evaluation measures. They applied multinomial logistic regression model to predict the drowsiness rating of eight participants who performed a simulated driving task under low and high arousal conditions.
- **Results and Conclusion**: The document reports that the prediction accuracy of drowsiness was high (more than 0.9) for almost all combinations of evaluation measures, and the highest (0.982) when all 11 measures were used. The authors also found that the interval from -40s to -20s before the prediction point in time was the most effective for predicting drowsiness. The authors conclude that using both physiological and behavioral measures is promising for drowsiness prediction, and suggest future research to develop more practical and economical methods.

The weakness from this article is that it does not provide any empirical evidence or real-world examples to support its claims about the effectiveness of physiological and behavioral measures for predicting drivers' drowsiness. The article relies mostly on statistical analysis of experimental data, which may not reflect the actual driving conditions and individual differences of drivers. Moreover, the article does not discuss the practical implications or limitations of its proposed method, such as the cost, feasibility, reliability, and validity of the measurement system and the prediction model. The article also does not compare its method with other existing or alternative methods for drowsiness detection or prevention. Therefore, the article lacks external validity and generalizability, and may not be convincing or useful for the readers who are interested in applying the method to real-world situations.

Some possible future work from this article are:

- **Developing a drowsiness prediction system using only behavioral measures.** The article showed that behavioral measures such as neck bending angle, back pressure, and foot pressure were effective for predicting drivers' drowsiness. However, physiological measures such as EEG, ECG, and EOG were also used, which may not be cost-efficient or practical for real-world applications. Therefore, a future work could explore the feasibility and accuracy of using only behavioral measures for drowsiness prediction.
- **Identifying the timing of falling asleep and causing a traffic accident.** The article focused on predicting subjective drowsiness ratings based on physiological and behavioral measures. However, subjective drowsiness may not always correspond to the actual risk of falling asleep and causing a traffic accident. Therefore, a future work could investigate the objective indicators of sleep onset and crash occurrence, and explore whether they can be predicted in advance using the measures adopted in this study.
- **Comparing different methods of data analysis and prediction.** The article used multinomial logistic regression as the method of data analysis and prediction for drowsiness. However, there may be other methods that could perform better or differently, such as neural networks, support vector machines, or decision trees. Therefore, a future work could compare different methods of data analysis and prediction, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses for drowsiness prediction.
